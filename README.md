1) I have searched online for phishing emails which has all the phishing traits included ( For detailed explanation and study )
   Found one sample phishing email sent by spoofing the name of "BEST BUY" mentioning that the recievers order is placed.
2) I have examined the sender's email address and display name. I found that they both doesn't match which is a trait.
3) I have extracted that email's header and used an online header analyzer to analyze that header.
   TOOL = MxToolbox
4) I have identified suspicious links and attachments provided by the attacker in that email.
    I have done that by just hovering my mouse and verifying its integrity
5) I have checked for unprofessional wordings , spelling mistakes and other signs which could be identified as traits.
6) I have identified the language and matter which shows the "Urgency and slightly threatning" where it shows the attacker is desparate.
7) Finally I have summarized all the work that I have done and created a word document.
